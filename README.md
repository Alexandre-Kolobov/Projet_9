How to run the program:
	1)To set up the virtual environment, please make sure that you have a python version higher that 3.3 (in prompt: python --version) because you need to have the pip installer.

	2)You have to create a folder ( /YOUR_FOLDER) and go in with the command line. In command line plese make "python -m venv venv" to create the virtual envrinment named "venv".

	3)To activate venv, via command line:
		For Windows: venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 (with powershell) or use commande "source Scripts/activate" (if you use bash)
		For Linux: venv/bin/activate
 
	4)Place your command line in /YOUR_FOLDER and then "git clone https://github.com/Alexandre-Kolobov/Projet_9.git"
	
	5)In the folder make "pip install -r requirements.txt" to set up the right configuration
